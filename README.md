# Project Overview -

Our hypothetical Company has announced that they would like to get into the movie industry. They will be creating a studio, however they have no knowledge of the movie industry. My goal is to collect, clean, and analyze movie data from a variety of sources so that I can provide recommendations to the company that will allow them to be successful in the movie industry.

## Python Libaries Used:
pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlip, datetime

## Data and Exploration: 

### 1. Web-scrapping -
The web-scraped data used in this project was collected from the following sources:

### 3. Exploration Questions-

In my analysis I explore and answer the following questions:

i.) What are the most profitable movies and how much should you spend?<br>
ii.) Which movie genres are most commonly produced and does quantity equate to higher net profits?<br>
iii.) What is the best time of the year to release a movie?<br>
iv.) Which actors and directors tend to add the most value?<br>
v.) How much money should you spend to win an Oscar?<br>
vi.) What impact, if any, does runtime and movie rating have on Net Profit, Profit Margin and IMDb rating?<br>
vii.) Sticking to our analysis of Net Profit and Profit Margin, what should our Company determine to be the baseline for sustainable success?<br>
viii.) Based on the success of current competitors, which should we look to for best practices?
